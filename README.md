A breakdown of the core functionality and technical highlights of the application.

### **1. Core Functionality**

- **Create & Edit**: Modal-based interface for distraction-free writing.  
- **Organization**: Categorize notes into Work, Personal, or Ideas.  
- **Smart Filtering**: Filter notes by category via the sidebar or search by keyword.  
- **Responsive Design**: Fully adaptive layout (Grid view on Desktop, collapsible Sidebar on Mobile).

### **2. UI/UX Highlights**

- **Duplicate Detection**: Automatically detects if a note with the same title exists in a category and displays a visual "DUPLICATE" badge.
